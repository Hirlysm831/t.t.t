## APT Coming ##

Students including me are going to have an Academic Proficiency Test in exactly two days. people who have chosen to major different subjects are preparing for those subjects they did not choose-our school is not a university , after all, and none of our daring students should be _avoiding_ any subjects.

The last day, I spent all the indie-study time on reviewing History, and end up with being sick about any Chinese word. Only reading English Materials could help me out then.

Somehow I was inspired that everybody is currently somehow _engaged_ with some kind of bedeviling stuff. Suddenly it gave me more courage to face my own challenge (although I am not lacking it).

## Keystrokes #

Just a moment ago I watched Professor Cao using computer. It amazed me so much, since he was doing it so efficiently.

His left hand is always striking above the lower left part of the keyboard, while his right hand kept controlling the mouse.

As it happened just in a casual break during classes, which just lasts for seven minutes, visiting an internet site, grabbing a BT torrent and uploading it to his cloud-based download center requires lightning speed. It is only him that could ever achieve it!

Differing himself from computer newbie, he has mastered the art of keystrokes. He knows what combinations help, and what does not.

I have asked him why he always ignores a few famous keystrokes. He simply replied, "Well, they take more nanoseconds to switch my right hand onto the position.¡±

A successful man definitely knows what to give up!
