##Back##

The.tslmy.tk finally came back on its feet again. there had been a few unexpected technical problems around it. finally Jack offered me a link to a new free hosting provider and everything goes so far so good.

##Puppy Linux##

Puppy Linux has always been a great set of Linux distributions aimed to be both lightweight and usable. we love to carry it all around in our USB drive, which enables us to use a work environment with well-personalized settings wherever had a computer, without editing any preferences already set by the owner himself and get into a unnecessary conflict.

It is always included in my USB OS Package, although I rarely use it, unless I have issue which is only solvable under Linux environment, typically file system errors.

##Why I Prefer Windows to Linux, The English Version##

Nearly one year ago, I wrote a Chinese article about why I chose windows as my own OS, in order to kill time. as you have witnessed, a moment ago, I was about to write something for puppy linux, but I halted, as I suddenly realized that explaining why I rarely use Linux to all you English readers is that necessary.

### Context ###

#### It Lacks Games

Yes, I am much a gamer than a student on computer. that is also the reason why I begged my father for buying me a better graphic card a few years ago.

#### It Slow

I really do not know why, may be there was something with the drivers.

#### I Am Used To Windows

Almost all the maximized windows in windows is able to be closed when user clicks on exactly the right-uppermost pixel on the screen, while it hardly applies to linux.

#### Fragile

Relatively, since you are much more powerful than you used to in windows.

#### Too Many Choices

At first, I was fallen into kind of happiness when I found that there are so many choices. later, I gradually realized how heavy this burden is, for a full-time student to test all of them out to choose one that fits him best.
