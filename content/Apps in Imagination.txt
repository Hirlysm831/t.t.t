Apps in Imagination
=====
Somehow, after a thorough research on smartphone OS-s, I became eager about my own one (let's just call it _MyOS_).

User Interface is, however, not the major part, since I've got  my imaginary desktop OS -- [Cos](httpc.lrin.tk) and my own website (not imaginary this time) --[Tslimitic](httptslmy.tk) to care about.
So,the really functioning part, the _apps_, is considerable.

Unities
-------
Smartphone should be able to take good care for itself before assisting user. 
You brought your phone to assist you, not to assist it!

So a few apps come in handy
###Wifily
This app checks WiFi signals around, and displays them in a variety of charts.

3G4G5G(may be available if my OS should come into being) and so on mobile networks can also have a app like this.  
Vodafone signal better here Switch to it.
T-mobile better there Switch.
Always get the best signal dBm, as long as enough SIM cards are inserted!

###Lino
Somewhat like sister Siri, but smarter and local(in contrast of Siri's requesting server). 
It's an AI.

   You can teach her what to do or say under a told condition.
   It remembers events and have feeling, so DO remember to present a bunch of flower asking for forgiving your rudeness last weekend if she kept ignoring all of your jokes.

###Controller
It's the Control Panel of your phone, your accounts and your personal rocket as well (if you got one).

###Console
People know you are a advanced user when they see you do things in console (and I hardly understands this phenomenon). 
They also know your phone is a high-tech gadget when they saw the Console app, which continuously implies your smartphone's keyboard!

###Grapher
Other apps put numeral steams into Grapher and it draws intended graph.  
Useful when monitoring CPU usage, heartbeats, network connections, etc.

###Notification Bar
This is like the one in Android, with richer controls. 
For example

   __Music Player Bar__ offers simple music control on it's bar.
   __Your-Friend-Just-Added-New-Photo Bar__ provides with simple slideshow.
   __Each single sentence or entry__ in your IM, RSS feeds, SMS and Email chats show here as a individual bar.

You can check out [Cos BluPrint](httpc.lrin.tk), and this is shown on the right-hand side.

###Voice Toys
These two plays with voice IO.
####TTS
Richer characteristic than any other TTS engine.
####Voice Recognition
It exceeds others, since it recognizes every language(even slang), without Internet Connection.

###Basic Commuication
Please don't tell me you forgot it's a _phone_...
####Dial
Fuzzily searches through your contacts.
###Contact
Automatically looks for further information about people within your Failbook, Goggle-, Fwittor, etc.
###SMS and Email
They just integrates together.

FUAK
---------
The abbreviation _FUAK_ stands for Frequently Used App Kit, the ones you uses most frequently.

###Newsstood
Not only a Google Reader client.
The serialized novels you are reading are also included!
###LinoTask
The best easy-to-use, distraction-free TO-DO managing app. Windows version [here](httpssf.netptslmylinotask).
###EveryNote++

Players
------------

###Player

###Picasa
No more to say, just a photo manager.

###¦Ìsic
A powerful music player, comes with a built-in DJ sets. 
Connected with Spotify, Grooveshark, Pandora and so on, it's backed up with a unlimited amount of audio to enjoy.

Of course, deciding whether to play a song by analyzing it's emotion and how the wind blows.
###Reder
It's the text file reader of your phone, in a iOS's-Newsstand-style. 
HTML, plain-text, Real-time rendered Markdown...whatever in text.

Actually, it is called _[iReader](httpwww.zhangyue.com)_ in China
(not including the Markdown part).


Accessories
--------

###Remote Set
####Remote Control
No matter it's via VNC or 3389, it will be the touchscreen of your computer.  
Of course you can't expect a small phone to hack through your electricity wire to your PC -- it's nearly Impossible.

####Another Screen
With an additional driver to your computer, your desktop OS will take your phone's little screen as another screen (resolution customizable!), extending your vista.

####Any Remote
Remote anything that's remotely controllable. Including

   Air conditioner
   TV
   Home stereo
   DSLR

###Paint
Can you believe that many phones with touchscreens are __without__ this _fantasy_ and _fun_ functionality to show off their touch-ability!

Just mock how conventional the factor is.

###Camera
Along with effects like in Instagram and Pudding Camera.

###Calc
Just heard about a calculator that understands natural language, and it may be in my MyOS.

###Torch
Touch the _Torch_ icon to lighten your LED flash light (into a flashlight) and touchscreen, then delight everybody even without your lighter.

Click it when and only when emergency happens.

It just simply reach the best network around and sends every kind of SOS signals to the outside world.
