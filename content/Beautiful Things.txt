#Beautiful Things

>The melody that you like best,
>harmonica¡¯s sound echoing in the vast sky...

#Introduction

This is a beautiful Japanese song by Sound Horizon, named _Beautiful Things_ (originally _Utsukushiki Mono_). I discovered this song via a mailing list for ACG fans, and since then it has been one of my favorites.

The singer¡¯s elegant voice perfectly matched the lyric, creating a harmonic atmosphere for the four-season travel story. In spite of the wartime background (which you could hardly tell by its graceful, worry-free vocal), the heart-warming love the sister expressed to her younger brother, gently melted into each line.

#Review

The song companied me into every sweet dream in the early July, 2011. It was like a canned breeze. Whenever I hit the play button, the breeze rolls out, carrying a gentle-voiced syllable ¡°ki¡±, then comes the chirping of birds. It weeps out all the tiredness and intense heat of summer, replaces them with nothing but comfort.

Generally, this song listens soft and light. It's not the sparkling or dazzling kind of light. Rather,it's an silky feel.

##The Ending

There is not only softness, but also energetic part. When the song is about to come to its end, it fades out, vocal fades in:

>In the morning you were born,
>I, who was a crybaby...
>came into a big sister.
>Though (I was) happy,
>Though (I was) a little shy...
>I was very proud.

Now this is the part where the background story is told, and it's also the part Sound Horizon's fans cheers for, for it finally connected _Beautiful Things_' story with other Sound Horizon songs in plot:

>You ran through this wilderness of life, ravaged by hardship
>In search of "things of beauty"
>Your sleeping face as you set off on a journey to the endless horizon
>Was the most beautiful thing of all, I thought...

This paragraph repeated again, but with stronger and faster rhythm this time. It concludes all the repetitions before, and pushed the sone into its climax:

>This melody that you love... the sound of the harmonica echoing in the vast sky...
>The canvas in the window frame embraced by the angel... say... is that landscape... pretty?

After that, the story ends, with the slow, peaceful dialogue of two girls. Since I am not familiar with Sound Horizon's works (actually, I've forced myself to have a try on their other songs but soon exited--they are just not so pleasant to my ear like the way _Beautiful Things_ appeals to it.) , I failed to find out who the two girls are.

>"I saw the most beautiful light in the world
>And, embracing that flower in my heart, will continue to sing of Laurant..."



>"Could a story be found over there...?"
