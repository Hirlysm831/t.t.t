## noip , again ##

tomorrow is the first exam of NOIP of this year.

noip, which is like a little or basic version of noi, is a competition for smart students to try out their skills of dealing with problems in c or Pascal language. I will be there tomorrow, too.

*   at the very first, as in grade seven, I heard of noip for the first time. but i was an total novice who could do nothing but read specific textbooks. in order to get involved as soon as possible, I chose pascal instead of cpp as someone said it is easier. ., but now it comes to that i could read c and cpp codes too. ,.
*   at grade eight, i attended noip the first time. we went to Baoding for second exam.
*   at grade nine, in Tangshan.
*   at grade ten, which was the first time i take part in the ..improved group, was in Handan.

## noip, continued ##
congratulations came from teachers, classmates, colleagues, and even parents that I got a relatively high score of eighty-two for the first exam of noip. The highest score of my city is said to be eighty-six, by the way.

this time, we are leaving for Shijiazhuang for the second exam of noip, where I attended for another oral-English competition called outlook in may, this year.

thanks god that all three of us(yes, Mr. Liu not attended, which I consider a huge lost for our team and a great plus to our joy there) are granted to take part in the second exam. what miracle will happen to us, see.
