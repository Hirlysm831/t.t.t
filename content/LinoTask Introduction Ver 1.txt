##Why Will I Love It?##

* Microsoft notepad was your favorite but you are now tired of saving every single time you made changes
* open window, type, hit return. that is the very way you would like your noting process be.
* Because your to-dos are all plain texts, no multimedia required
* Much more importantly, you want your deleting entries to be that easy, too !
* your hands wants to be on your keyboard, not switching a lot between mouse and keyboard during adding and deleting an entry.
* you want to be geeky, so a console interface would delight you
* synced with Dropbox, etc. , you think that you might have the chance to edit your to-do list file by hand on some platform, such as your android phone. So the list is better to be a line-by-line .txt file.
* The smaller the program file size is the better to you.
* Freeware.
* sometimes you are in a situation when you have to hurriedly bookmark some web links to somewhere and need to pick them up afterwards as soon as possible. as your messy bookmark bar may
