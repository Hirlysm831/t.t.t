_('Lino' pronounced as 'Lin No' here. It's the name of a set of programming projects. )_

###### This a simple task-managing program made by Li Mingyang(also known as Tslmy, Tslimingyang or Lino).

Highly recommend V0.4 WEB UPGRADED version, which is most capable for use. 

#### Recommended to those who had thoughts like below:
- I just want a simple way to write my one-sentence-long note down
- Micro$oft Notepad is very nice
- But it seems not cool, and I HATE saving a lot, this might be very dangerous if I forget once.
- Maybe console controlling seems cooler
- And I would like to edit my tasks with notepad straightly some times

#### Notice :
I'd like to draw your attention on that I just uploaded a 'Lite' version of V0.3. I deleted some intelligent functions so sadly you can only delete a task by type in the number from now on.
For those who thought it's not safe to delete a task without a notification, I added a history-recording function in the Lite version.
Why I removed that function? I found a new bug and I did't want to fix it. At that time I came up with the 'history' idea and it seems work better without that function I removed.

##### V0.4 Usage:
- Just type in.
- If what you typed is already in the Task List, it will be deleted.
- - Else, it will be added as a new task (this is also the main function).
-If it contains an URL that starts with "http://", it will be added with a head of "[WEB]". When you open this entry, it will open in your default browser. 
--WARNING! You can only add some notes in WEB entries at the beginning!
---If you didn't make and note for a WEB entry, LinoTask V0.4 WEB UPGRADED (and newer versions) will task some time to grab the title of the URL and Use it as the note.
- If you've typed in a number, LinoTask will check if it is a ID
- - If it is, it will be deleted;
- - If it's not(bigger than the biggest ID in the Task List), it will be added as a new task.

-----------------------------------
- Special Usages (only works in V0.3!):

1.Type "/" and an ID as a single command to toggle "(!)" sign on/off.

2.Type "'" at the beginning of a sentence to force add it as a task. 

##### Known Bugs:
Please ensure that there is one and only one empty line at each of the end of the .txt files when you finished your editing with notepad :)
