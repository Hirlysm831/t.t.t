## The Problem of All ##

Limited by functionality, some devices can only display plain txt files correctly. That is why people invented a variety of markup languages to make plain texts better.

The first and best markup language is the famous Markdown by JOHN GRUBER ([site]( http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) .it looks brilliant and tastes fabulous.

The problem of mine is much more serious.

As students, we are not allowed to bring large electronic devices to school, so my only portable text processor is only an electronic dictionary, which I mentioned before as i530. It¡¯s handy in various ways, but has only got star mark and question mark on the basic keyboard ¨C that¡¯s right, not even full-stop and comma!

### Electronic Dictionary ###
Since I am not sure whether my readers will understand what is an electronic dictionary, I am going to explain it a little.

The so-called _electronic dictionary_ is a kind of electronic device sized like a PDA, mainly provided with sets of English dictionaries for Chinese students to look up in.

It¡¯s popular in school, and generally the richer the student is, the better electronic dictionary he gets. Of course, if allowed, mobile phones will also cause the controversy.

This kind of device can do more than that. Basically, most of them have MP3 Player, E-Books, and, like my i530, Notebook.

So I had to invent another markup language for this special purpose. at first, I did not know that there are other markup languages that I could absorb ideas from, so I decided all the formats all on myself.

The first version was a prototype, although it came with edit-friendly structures from the beginning. It has shortages, of course. So I decided to update the code, make it Markdown-capable.



## This Program Is Called Diarier ##

Writing plain English is difficult; coding is, as you may guessed, extremely difficult. So it is the first function that I left out in this convertor.

Next, should be the basics -- title, italic, bold, underline and color. Special patterns might be introduced to indicate these functionalities.

What worried me the most is how I should program it. Since it will need character replacement, I can have it check all the words in the paragraph individually. But, sometimes things just got more complex. There are patterns that are combined with normal words at the beginning or ending. It seems wiser o use regular expression library straightly.

At last, I managed it before December. This program allows i530 users to convert their notes into Proper markdown texts. Such as:

This is good? Right?qs? Yes*

Will be converted into:

This is good, right? Yes.

Since then, I started to enjoy more writing diaries.
