Music Recommendation - Fakevox
==============================
I rarely recommend a whole album, especially when it includes tracks that just for making up the number. However, those "Bonus" tracks _Fakevox_(by _Plus-Tech Squeeze Box_) are a exception.

I got to know this album about one months ago. My favorite song in this album, _A Day in the Radio_, was then used as the BGM of a popular MAD([マッド][]), [_Just Smile_][]. It sounded so cute, especially when _Tachibana Kanade_ outstretched her little white finger with that lyric "It's okay..." softly(but also determinedly) fluttered out.

Note
-----
Since this is __not__ a professional music recommendation blog, I am just going to write my review in my own order.   
This means, 

* you can't easily navigate to a specific review of a track, 
* nor can you expect the same factor that I used to rate a track showed up in another track review.

Gathering information
-------
As a 2001-released debut album of a less-known [Japanese electronic music band named _Plus-tech Squeeze Box_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus-Tech_Squeeze_Box), it is hard to get complete information for that: I spent an afternoon searching all over the web, downloading and installing as well as cracking a music download software, just to get a low-quality trial version of that song.   
As expected, lyrics are much harder to get than the album itself.

Accent
------
This album was published both in Japan and the UK. May be as a consequence, some songs listen like it's written in English. As people know, the odd Japanese-accented English is more than difficult to dictate. What I could figure out was only "It's morning people" and even the "people" was "pi-po"!

Today afternoon, I asked one of my friends to dig that out for me. He really made some progress! After reading the lyrics he found online, I felt extremely speechless.

Golden Time
-----------
Most of the songs in this album have their choruses near the end, and them sounded awesome.

For example:

* X: 2'50~3'07
* Rocket Coaster: 1'58~2'19
* Test Room 2'34~2'40
* A Day In The Radio: 2'00~2'29
* Early Riser: 1'56~2'05
* Milk Tea: 2'40~end
* Sneaker Song: 2'45~2'49(Yeah, this one is short)

Romantic
-----
I wondered why this confusingly-named album is themed in universe, astronaut, etc. Was there something important about aerospace happened in Japan? Don't know... Anyway, some songs really attracted me -- like I said, even the bonus track, _Scene 1-Launch A Spaceship Into Space_ sounded so real. 

There was one sentence in the track _X_(it's actually just a cross) made me moved:

>I know you take me to future space. Yeah...

This sentence was repeated from time to time. The very moment when I was impressed was in the "Golden Time" of this song, when:

* the man sings gently and caringly
* along with the little girl's singing languidly
* and the BGM so light...
* apparent echo creating the vast and empty atmosphere of the surrounding, which, in this case, is the outer space(although real outer space allows no echo...)

mixed together.

I found this sentence surprisingly "romantic" and could not explain myself.  

The first single word appeared in my mind when I heard it was, in spite of my native Chinese language, "romantic".  
I can't explain why a adult man and an adolescent girl(sounds like) would have something can be described as "romantic", but this feeling just stayed, unchangeable. It's like even replacing it with its nearest synonym would be unfit...savvy?

Almost every little boy had the dream to be a astronaut or visit the future, and maybe my dream resonated with that. Yeah, that must be the reason.

Of course there are many other inspiring moments in this album, like that playful and naive one in _Sneaker Song_: the main rhythm was converted into 8-bit style but the drumss tone stayed the same clear...

Conclusion
----------
Anyhow, this is a cute and attractive album that you Japanese pop song fans should give a little try. Buying the original album seems no longer possible, so try the trials online if you can.
