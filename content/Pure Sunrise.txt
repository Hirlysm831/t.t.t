Pure sunrise
===

Being a early riser is not always bad. I am just a early riser enough (never too much) to fetch the beautiful [sunrise][] landscape.

Preparing for a exam alone in a Study Room that faces south, I could enjoy a bright and grand view here. Every morning, I could say hello to the young sun, watching it gradually rises.  It's relatively fast when compared to the usual, when you dare not to look at it directly. 

As time went by, the sun gently hugs me with his warm arms. Sometimes, he does tricks on me: he would brighten the whole page so much that I could not even really read. In this condition, i could only hide, hide and hide.

He also hides. After our early-served supper, he starts to run away. When I hurried back to my room, he would not be there. I want to pull him back, but failed to catch the tail of sunlight... so I could only wait for the next meet-up, which,  hopefully, would be in less than 10 hours.
