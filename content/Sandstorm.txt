Today I¡¯ll talk about a disaster named sandstorm (also written as ¡®sand storm¡¯). It¡¯s a usual disaster in some of China¡¯s big cities like Beijing. 

When a sandstorm comes, the color of the atmosphere will be yellow. You cannot open your mouth in the open air, because these sands will blow into your mouth and you will feel like eating sand rice! This is one of the results of sands in the storm. Then where do they from? The sands come from deserts in the inner part of Asia (that¡¯s very far away, I think). When the atmosphere in that place rotates, it makes winds, just like a tornado. And this ¡®tornado¡¯ picks the sands up from the desert and goes on rotating towards someplace, like Beijing. And on its way, it drops parts of its sands. So not only Beijing has this kind of disaster, other places have, too.

One thing that I want to emphasize is that when sandstorm meets trees, especially woods or a forest, it will be slow down a little because of the obstruction from the trees. It also will be a little bit clearer, for the trees have stopped some of the sands. You can tell that this is obviously a good way to lessen the destruction of the sandstorms. In truth, cutting down woods is a very important reason of the sandstorms.

As the words teachers have repeated again and again, we should protect the environment and make our air clearer and clearer.
