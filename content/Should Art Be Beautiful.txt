Should Art Be Beautiful?


According to Wikipedia, "Art is the product or process of deliberately arranging symbolic elements in a way that influences and affects the senses, emotions, and/or intellect". But there are some which do not obey this definition, how and what could that be?

Should art be deliberately arranged? Some artists only throw his colors on the canvas, and it's done! Joan Mir¨® once had a paint, it's just like a drop of blue ink in a glass of orange juice. In 1949, Jackson Pollock, decided to use colors to show his strength, and his really did that -- the paint is called <>. Nevertheless, Kandinsky (1866~1944) also painted a paint called<>, however, I think this "universe map" is better in its structure. Are these circles, and those splashed colors really "arranged"?

As you might tell from some same-kind works, some "out-of-definition" works still can be appreciated even if they are not exactly planned. To be honest, even if I know clearly about a "freshing" paint that it is extremely ugly to the most and was not planned at all, I will still like it. 

Just like me, there were lots of discussions about the same topic, too. And a number of professors also agree that arts may not be beautiful, as long as it could be appreciated, it is enough to be a good work of art. Professor Gu and Professor Tian once published a article about their opinion to this question. Two months later, a group of collage students majored in art, also made their studies public in the art circle. More and more are now agreeing with the "beautiful is not the most important part to judge if one work is art or not" idea.

The new types are growing gradually since the modern arts begun to be popular in the world, but which one will be the winner?
 Just see.
