You Stepped into this room. The room is a bit narrow, and filled with daily things like clothes, books, a table and a chair. Because there's a bit dark, you want to find out whether there is someone else here. Your eye first locked on the chair, there is no one here. But, however, you can tell this room belongs to a child from the height the chair is set at.

Suddenly you noticed that you are not supposed to be here. You tried to look back worriedly, but you couldn't. That's not because you are caught by something, instead, you just cannot look back. From the bright lights and cold winds came straightly behind you, you guessed that the room is moving. For a purpose of nature, you looked out from the only window at the front of the room, whose blue sides seems out of fashion, looks like a 19th century decoration.

Yes, it's flying up. birds stopped at the top of the window's fence, and next moment it flied away. When it got off the fence, it was pushed down by the wind rapidly. Poor bird!

You were terrorized. For two seconds your brain was like a piece of white paper. And next moment, with out further considering, you decided to escape from this room.

But how can you? You can not turn around, and it is impossible to escape from the window. Your brain showed you an idea -- you closed your eyes, took a deep, very deep breath, and lean back -- you dropped down from the carpet in front of the room door.
