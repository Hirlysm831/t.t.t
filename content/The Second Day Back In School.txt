## The Second Day Back In School ##
I am stil looking forward going back home at seven and play out like i did during summer vacation.

I forgot two books home, Which sadly indicated my unconsiciousness at school.

## All The Things I Wanted In Summer Holiday ##

All the little toys i wanted -- such as mao quote, Travellers notebook from midori, Nice flashlight and the socalled bi lian -- Did not come true after all.
## My Treasurable Golden Times ##
Siting right inthe classroom, All the scenes in the past school days flashbacked on me -- 

+   Writing scripts for yuan dan performance,
+   Taking my litle schoolbag to FE classroom after simple dinner, 
+   Using puppy linux on grade masters computer during night independent stdies, 
+   Playing all kinds of ball games with japanese teacher before night IS , 
+   Working in the library,
+   in grade seven, Taking my stuff from computer classroom on fifth floor back to our own classroom on the first floor after nightfall. 

These are my treasurable golden times.

## Blogging ##

Professor liu started to update his wordpress based website these days. As i appreciate the way making a website all be oneself from source code much more than using templates that was already made by others, I treat his step a backwardness.

My blog, [The.Tslmy.Tk](http://the.tslmy.tk), Is based on a static blogging system that i made all by myself. Although seldom updated, I consider this site one of my good works.

Jack is trying this system these days and found it difficult to understand. 
Of course. Because it needs python two environment to generate the article list, All you have to do is save your artice into txt files, Run create. Ty, Upload new documents via ftp to your web space by hand. It is an minimal project. Lol.
