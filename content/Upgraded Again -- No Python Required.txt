Lilo-log Upgraded, again!

__Great!__

This time, I _bravely_ removed tags and briefs for each article, which brightened the whole index page.

The major change is that, from now on,

##PYTHON SCRIPTS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED!!##

All you need is PHP now. Every single time people visit your t.t.t-powered website, index.php
will go and collect all your txt files, so you don't have to worry about updating _list.txt any more.


Next are the codes I removed today:

      <?php
      $file = fopen("_list.txt", "r");
      while (!feof($file)) {
          $name = fgets($file);
          if ($name != "") {
              echo "<li><a href='view.php?name=" . $name . "'>" . $name . "</a>";
              echo "<br/><div class='brief'>" . fgets($file) . "</div>";
              echo "<div class='tag'>" . fgets($file) . "</div><hr>";
          } else {
              break;
          }
      }
      fclose($file);
    ?>
    
    .brief{
        color:#444;
        position:relative;
        top:-5px;
        display:inline;
        font-family: Tahoma;
    }
    .tag{
        position:float;
        float:right;
        top:auto;
        display:inline;
    }

Have a nice day!
