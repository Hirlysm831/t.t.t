My very personal plain-text blog.
Welcome, my friend.
I am Tslmy from China, now a senior school student.
I had my little touch at HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, Pascal, BASIC(if it counts), Flash, Audition, Photoshop, After Effects, C/C++, and so on.
I am now looking forward to opportunities for geeky jobs, in order to prepare for my after-university life.
I like making friends, you can reach me at:
