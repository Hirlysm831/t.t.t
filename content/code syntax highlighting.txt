# Another major upgrade
Another major upgrade has been commited to _t.t.t_. This upgrade added __code syntax highlighting__ functionality to _t.t.t_.

The syntax highlighter engine itself is called Highlight.js, hosted on <http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/>.

###Official description

>Highlight.js highlights syntax in code examples on blogs, forums and in fact on any web pages. It's very easy to use because it works automatically: finds blocks of code, detects a language, highlights it.   
>This is not only convenient but also allows highlighting for code examples marked up with writing syntaxes like Markdown where there is no way to specify HTML class easily.   
>The library knows 41 languages and is bundled with 16 style themes.   
>Developers and designers are welcome to take part in development.   

### Why I chose Highlight.js

As articles on t.t.t is based on _Markdown_, adding original HTML to which will cause untidiness, it's nearly impossible for me to add a tag describing what language the code is in.   
Highlight.js, unlike other syntax highlighters, will automatically detect the language, and then give the code block a proper brush. Demo is also available on <http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html>.

### google-code-prettify

In truth, I've tried out about six highlighters, and before meeting my final choice, I put my hand on _google-code-prettify_([official website here](http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html)), which also does it automatically. Besides, it's really lightweighted.

But, it turned out that, in order to cooperate it with the Markdown render engine, I had to edit the source code of _Markdown.php_! That's dangerous, so I finally give up.

### At last

Well, you programming folks who want to use t.t.t, it's time now!
