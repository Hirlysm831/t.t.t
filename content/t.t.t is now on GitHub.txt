I've been talking about pushing my t.t.t onto Git network for wider sharing, and now it's accomplished.

I know that, I just denied my recent learning Git, But... sometimes you just got leisure time with nothing to do, you know. 

# So from now t.t.t is settled on GitHub!#
t.t.t blog engine now available at: <https://github.com/tslmy/t.t.t>

Next plan? Maybe moving .txt file hosting to Git network, too.
